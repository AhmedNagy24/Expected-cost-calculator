# Expected-cost-calculator
the program gauges the expected cost of an item in a specified number of years.
It is difficult to make a budget that spans several years, because prices are
not stable. If your company needs 200 pencils per year, you cannot simply
use this yearâ€™s price as the cost of pencils 2 years from now. Because of
inflation the cost is likely to be higher than it is today. The
program asks for the cost of the item, the number of years from now that
the item will be purchased, and the rate of inflation. The program then
outputs the estimated cost of the item after the specified period.
